#### Why data structures?
- **Efficient Problem-Solving:** Choice of data structures makes certain operations more efficient while others difficult(trade offs).
- **Optimizing Resources:** Using the right data structure can significantly reduce the time and space complexity of a program.
- **Foundations for Algorithms:** Choice of data structures allows or limits the algorithms that can be applied on a problem.

#### So far: IT112: Introduction to programming
- Primitive data types (int, char, float etc.)
- Control Structures(for-loop, while-loop, if-else etc.),
- Structured Programming(functions, switch, if-else),
-  Arrays, Strings, and Pointers
- Dynamic memory allocation and de-allocation efficiently.

---
#### Where we want to go

- Apply C++ and Object Oriented Programming(OOPs) constructs to implement Data Structures


---
#### Game plan

- Revise important concepts common to C/C++
- Understand OOPs concepts
	- Classes and Objects
	- Encapsulation
	- Polymorphism
	- Operator Overloading
- Understand C++ concepts crucial for Data structures implementation
	- Templates
	- Iterators
	- Containers
- Follow IT205
